## What I work on

I design and build **end-to-end AI systems** for sports performance analysis, focusing on computer vision and multimodal learning.

My work spans:
- Object detection & keypoints
- Ball & shuttle tracking
- Action recognition & shot classification
- Sports biomechanics & motion analysis

Below are selected projects that reflect **real-world sports problems**, engineering depth, and applied outcomes.
