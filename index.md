# Yash Vardhan
## Sports Performance Computer Vision Analyst  
**Cricket & Badminton**

I build **video-based sports intelligence systems** that convert raw match and training footage into **player tracking, technique evaluation, and tactical insights** for analysts, coaches, and sports tech teams.

My work focuses on **computer vision under real-world constraints** — fast motion, occlusion, noisy video, and limited compute — with an emphasis on **decision-ready outputs**, not just model accuracy.

## What I Specialize In

- Player, ball, and shuttle **tracking & trajectory analysis**
- **Shot and action intelligence** using temporal video cues
- **Pose-based technique & biomechanics analysis**
- **Audio–visual event detection** for automated segmentation
- Translating vision outputs into **performance and tactical insights**

## How I Build Sports Intelligence Systems

My system design philosophy — from **problem framing and annotation** to **evaluation, failure analysis, and iteration** — shaped by real-world sports data and production constraints.

## What I Care About

- Solving **real sports problems**, not toy datasets  
- Building vision systems that survive **noise, speed, and occlusion**  
- Producing outputs that **coaches and analysts can act on**
