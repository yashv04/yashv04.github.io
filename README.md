# Yash Vardhan — Sports Analytics & Sports Tech AI Engineer

I build data-driven intelligence systems for cricket and racket sports, spanning:
- Match & tactical prediction
- Player impact and performance modeling
- Computer vision for sports (tracking, action recognition, biomechanics)
- Analyst-ready tools for teams, fantasy platforms, and broadcasters

## Why My Work Matters
I focus on **real-world sports problems**, not toy datasets — building systems that survive noisy video, fast motion, and imperfect data.
