# Yash Vardhan  
## Sports Performance Computer Vision Analyst (Cricket & Badminton)

I build **video-based sports intelligence systems** that convert raw match and training footage into **player tracking, technique evaluation, and tactical insights** for analysts, coaches, and sports tech teams.

My work focuses on **computer vision under real-world sports constraints** — fast motion, occlusion, noisy video, and limited compute — with an emphasis on **decision-ready outputs**, not just model accuracy.

## What I Specialize In

- Player, ball, and shuttle **tracking & trajectory analysis**
- **Shot and action intelligence** using temporal video cues
- **Pose-based technique & biomechanics analysis**
- **Audio–visual event detection** for automated segmentation
- Translating vision outputs into **performance and tactical decisions**

## How I Think About Sports AI

I approach sports AI as a **systems problem**, not a modeling exercise.

That means:
- Sports-first problem framing  
- Annotation strategies aligned with downstream decisions  
- Metric-driven evaluation and explicit failure analysis  
- Preference for robust, interpretable systems over fragile SOTA models  

The goal is always the same:
> Build systems that **coaches and analysts can trust**.
